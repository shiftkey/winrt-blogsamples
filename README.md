WinRT Blog Samples
=================

To get myself back into this "blogging" thing, I'm forcing myself to publish some samples of things I've tried and blogged about.

Some things I have in mind:

 - How these "language projections" work for people who do C#/C++/JS work?
 - How do you even do this? (contemplating porting [OAuthBase.cs](http://oauth.googlecode.com/svn/code/csharp/OAuthBase.cs) across)
 - The differences between porting to Metro and WinRT
 - Headaches that .NET developers are going to find when porting code across

Send me a PR of this file with something you'd like to see done...
