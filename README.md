WinRT Blog Samples
=================

To get myself back into this "blogging" thing, I'm forcing myself to publish some samples of things I've tried and blogged about.

Some things I have in mind:

 - How these "language projections" work for people who do C#/C++/JS work?
 - How do you even do this? (contemplating porting [OAuthBase.cs](http://oauth.googlecode.com/svn/code/csharp/OAuthBase.cs) across - other suggestions/projects that would be good candidates for this cross-language sharing?)
 - The differences between porting to Metro and WinRT
 - Headaches that .NET developers are going to find when porting code across

Got an idea? Send me a pull request of this README with something you'd like to see done...

These are old posts I've done which I need to update (and recreate the sample code):

 - [API Design and Windows Metadata Exporter](http://brendanforster.com/build/migration-tips-and-tricks.html)
 - [Customise a Windows Metadata File](http://brendanforster.com/build/customise-a-winmd-file.html)
