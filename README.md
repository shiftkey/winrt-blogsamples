WinRT Blog Samples
=================

Got an idea? Send me a pull request of this README with something you'd like to see done...

To get myself back into this "blogging" thing, I'm forcing myself to publish some samples of things I've tried and blogged about.

Things which I need to write up:

 - How these "language projections" work for people who do C#/C++/JS work?
 - How do you even do this? (contemplating porting [OAuthBase.cs](http://oauth.googlecode.com/svn/code/csharp/OAuthBase.cs) across - other suggestions/projects that would be good candidates for this cross-language sharing?)
 - Some cool tricks you can do with tile notifications 
 - The differences between porting to Metro and WinRT 
 - Headaches that .NET developers are going to find when porting code across

Some other additional ideas:
 
 - How could you backport Windows.* APIs to .NET (also known as the "@xpaulbettsx made me do it" experiment)
 - Form validation in XAML - did it come across? has it changed? what even is this?

These are old posts I've done which I need to update (and recreate the sample code):

 - [API Design and Windows Metadata Exporter](http://brendanforster.com/build/migration-tips-and-tricks.html)
 - [Customise a Windows Metadata File](http://brendanforster.com/build/customise-a-winmd-file.html)
